    <p>Transaction â€” is a transfer of money from one Entity to another Entity.</p>
    <p>Transaction can be created by anyone, from anyone to anyone.</p>
    <p>Transaction can be Confirmed or Non-Confirmed if you decide that you want to create a draft one / wait for a
        confirmation from other party. Non-Confirmed Transactions are like written cheques. Don't use them too
        frequently.</p>
