# refinance
![logo](docs/refinance-logo.jpg)

refined financial system for a hackerspace. simple by design.

## architecture

### entity
anything that can send or receive money: human, donate-box, rent, utility.

### transaction
move X from A to B. supports all currencies.
- non-confirmed
- confirmed

### balance
sum of all transactions. both confirmed and not. separated.

### tags
mark entities and transactions for quick search.

### security

- `X-Token` header is used for authentication.
- you may request a new token any time: `POST /tokens/send` with `name`, `id` or `telegram_id` of your entity — anything you remember.
- token (link) will be sent to `telegram_id` of the entity. newly generated tokens do NOT revoke old ones.

> token — [jwt](http://jwt.io) string with entity id & timestamp inside. basically `base64(sign(json(id=123, date=now())))`.

## run
### production
put secrets into `secrets.env`. see `secrets.env.example` as a reference. 

```console
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```
API: http://0.0.0.0:8000/docs
UI: http://0.0.0.0:9000

### development
run backend & frontend with live code reload:
```
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```
open http://localhost:8000/docs and http://localhost:9000

create local environment with all dependencies:
```console
pipenv install --dev
```
- open any .py file in vscode
- choose newly created env as python interpreter (bottom right button)
- now vscode intellisense will work correctly for all packages

if you need to change the Pipfile:
```console
pipenv requirements --exclude-markers --dev > requirements.txt
cp requirements.txt ui
cp requirements.txt api
```

to run api tests:
```
pipenv shell
cd api
pytest
```
