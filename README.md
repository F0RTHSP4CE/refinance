![logo](docs/refinance-logo.jpg)

refined financial system for a hackerspace. simple by design.

## architecture

### entity
anything that can send or receive money: human, donate-box, rent, utility.

### transaction
move X from A to B. supports all currencies.
- non-confirmed
- confirmed

### balance
sum of all transactions. both confirmed and not. separated.

### tags
mark entities and transactions for quick search.

## authentication
- you can request a login link with your entity name, telegram id, signal id or whatever.
- login link will be sent to all available destinations (telegram, signal, email, etc)
- new login link does not revoke old ones, so no one can deauthenticate you. 

## production

put secrets into `secrets.env`. see `secrets.env.example` as a reference. 

```console
make prod-daemon
```
