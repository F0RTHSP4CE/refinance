# ui-new Changelog Discipline

- For every user prompt in this repo, append an entry to `ui-new/changelog.md`.
- Add the changelog entry in the same response where changes are made.
- If no code files changed, still add a short "Docs/Guidance" entry.

## Entry format

Use this template:

```md
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
- Prompt: <short request summary>
- Changes:
  - <file or behavior 1>
  - <file or behavior 2>
- Notes: <follow-ups, caveats, or "none">
```

## Quality rules

- Keep entries concise and factual.
- Mention key files touched under `ui-new/` and integration points.
- Never rewrite previous entries; only append new ones.
